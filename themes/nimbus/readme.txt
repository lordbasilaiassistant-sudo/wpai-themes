A bright, conversion-grade SaaS and startup theme with a violet-to-indigo gradient hero.

== Description ==

Nimbus is a bright, conversion-oriented WordPress theme built for SaaS products,
startups, and product launches — and just as comfortable as a clean editorial blog.
A violet-to-indigo gradient powers the homepage hero, the pill buttons, and the
category chips; crisp white cards float on a soft light canvas; and a geometric
system sans keeps everything modern and fast. No page builders, no bloat, no tracking.

Posts on the index render as cover cards: a full-bleed featured image (or an elegant
gradient placeholder when none is set), an overlaid category chip, a clear byline, an
excerpt, and a read-more. The first post leads as a full-width feature. Single posts and
pages get a large featured image, a comfortable reading measure, styled headings,
blockquotes and lists, and a card sidebar that follows along on wide screens.

Features:

* Bright SaaS/startup aesthetic with a violet-to-indigo gradient hero and accents
* Cover-card post index with full-bleed featured images and a graceful gradient fallback
* Overlaid category chips, clear bylines, and a full-width lead feature post
* Two-column reading layout with a sticky card sidebar (collapses cleanly on mobile)
* Sticky, blurred header with a gradient pill primary navigation state
* Custom logo, primary navigation menu (with dropdowns), and a widgetized sidebar
* Threaded comments, accessible :focus-visible states, and reduced-motion support
* Block editor color palette, gradient, and font sizes via theme.json
* System font stack only — no external or Google fonts; translation-ready

== Installation ==

1. In wp-admin go to Appearance > Themes > Add New > Upload Theme.
2. Choose nimbus.zip and click Install Now.
3. Click Activate.
4. Set a Site Title and Tagline under Settings > General — the tagline anchors the hero.
5. Create a Primary menu under Appearance > Menus and assign it to "Primary Menu".
6. Add widgets under Appearance > Widgets to populate the sidebar.

== Changelog ==

= 1.4.0 =
* Added native integration with the free WPAI companion plugins via add_theme_support( 'wpai-companions' ).
* Single posts now fire `wpai_entry_top` (after the entry header, before the content) and `wpai_entry_bottom` (after the content, before the footer) action hooks, outside the prose column so companion output can use full article width.
* Styled the hooked output to look native to Nimbus: the Reading Time Badge wears the accent pill-chip look, the Contents box gets the theme's soft-indigo card and gradient eyebrow title, and the Kindred related-posts block matches the cover-card grid with the theme's springy hover lift — all driven by Nimbus's palette, spacing, type, and motion tokens, and fully reduced-motion safe.
* No double-rendering: when the companions are active they render only through the hooks; with the plugins inactive the theme is unchanged.

= 1.3.0 =
* Added a self-contained motion system (assets/js/motion.js, no libraries or CDNs): a living animated gradient-mesh hero, a magnetic gradient CTA, a small 3D tilt on post cards, springy staggered scroll-reveal entrances, count-up hero stats, and a scroll progress bar.
* Added a hero stats row (published stories, uptime, and teams) with animated count-up.
* Fully respects prefers-reduced-motion (JS self-gates and a CSS block disables every animation) and degrades gracefully with no JS via a `js`/`nm-motion` progressive-enhancement hook — all content stays visible.
* Animations are transform/opacity only (no layout thrash, no cumulative layout shift); scroll reveals use IntersectionObserver and unobserve after firing.

= 1.2.0 =
* Added Customizer color controls (Accent, Background, Secondary accent) under Appearance > Customize > Colors & Style with instant live preview.
* The single Accent control now cascades through every accent shade and the hero/button gradients via color-mix().
* Site title and tagline update live in the Customizer preview via selective refresh.

= 1.1.0 =
* Redesigned the post index as full-bleed cover cards with category chips and a lead feature.
* Added a two-column reading layout with a sticky card sidebar.
* Added graceful gradient placeholder covers for posts without a featured image.
* Refined the hero, single, page, comments, widgets, navigation, and 404 styling.
* Switched to a pure system font stack (removed external font references).
* Polished accessibility: focus states, reduced-motion support, alt passthrough.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release.
