A refined, minimal serif theme for personal blogs and essayists — a featured lead story, a quiet editorial list, and gorgeous reading typography.

== Description ==

Aurora is a calm, editorial WordPress theme built for writers. The blog home
leads with one large, beautifully set featured story, then settles into a tidy
list of cards — each with its featured image, category, byline, and a generous
excerpt. Long-form posts read on a comfortable measure (~68 characters) in a
warm serif, with tasteful headings, blockquotes, and code blocks.

It ships with real CSS — custom properties, a modular type scale, a responsive
two-column reading layout, and accessible focus states — and uses only
system/web-safe fonts, so it loads instantly with no external requests.

Features:

* Magazine-style blog home: a full lead story, then an elegant card list
* Featured images on the index, single, and pages — with a graceful gradient
  placeholder when a post has none, so the rhythm never breaks
* Category pills, bylines, and dates that organise the index at a glance
* Comfortable reading measure, serif body type, and balanced headings
* Two-column layout with a sticky, widgetised sidebar (Search, Recent Posts,
  Recent Comments, Archives, Categories all styled)
* Threaded comments and a polished comment form
* Accessible, responsive mobile navigation with a no-JS fallback
* Skip link, visible focus-visible states, semantic landmarks, AA contrast,
  and full prefers-reduced-motion support
* Block editor color palette and font sizes via theme.json
* Custom logo, primary + footer menus, and a styled 404
* Translation-ready (text domain: aurora). No external fonts, no tracking.

== Installation ==

1. In wp-admin go to Appearance > Themes > Add New > Upload Theme.
2. Choose aurora.zip and click Install Now.
3. Click Activate.
4. Set a Primary menu under Appearance > Menus, add widgets under
   Appearance > Widgets, and give your posts featured images for the best look.

== Changelog ==

= 1.4.0 =
* Native companion-plugin integration. Aurora now declares
  add_theme_support( 'wpai-companions' ) and fires `wpai_entry_top` and
  `wpai_entry_bottom` action hooks around the single-post article body —
  outside the prose column — so its free companion plugins place their output
  natively and at full article width.
* Reading Time Badge now renders just above the article (right under the
  title/meta) instead of inside the prose; the Contents box sits beneath it;
  and Kindred's related-posts block spans the full article width below the
  content, before the tags — no more double rendering via the_content.
* New "native skin" styling maps each companion's theming custom properties
  onto Aurora's tokens: terracotta accent, warm paper surfaces, serif
  headings and card titles, hairline rules, matching radii, the prev/next
  hover lift, and warm aurora-hue placeholders. Self-contained CSS, no extra
  requests, and full prefers-reduced-motion support preserved.

= 1.3.0 =
* New signature flourish: a hand-drawn ink underline (inline SVG) that draws
  itself, left to right, beneath the lead headline, single-post titles, and
  archive section labels — a quiet, crafted terracotta pen-stroke.
* Added a cohesive, subtle motion system (assets/js/motion.js, deferred and
  footer-loaded): gentle fade-and-rise reveals on scroll with a tasteful
  stagger, a word-by-word reveal on lead headlines, and a refined animated
  underline on body links.
* New slim reading-progress bar on single posts.
* Fully accessible and progressive: a 'js' class gates all motion so no-JS
  readers see everything; IntersectionObserver drives reveals and unobserves
  after firing; only transform/opacity animate (no layout shift); and
  prefers-reduced-motion is honoured in both the script and the stylesheet —
  everything reveals instantly with no animation.

= 1.2.0 =
* Added Customizer color controls (Accent, Background, Surface) under
  Appearance > Customize > "Colors & Style", with instant live preview —
  change a color and the whole theme updates without touching code.
* Accent shades (deep/soft/wash) now derive from the chosen accent via
  color-mix(), so a single accent change cascades everywhere.
* Live preview for the site title and tagline via selective refresh.

= 1.1.0 =
* Redesigned blog home with a full-width featured lead story and a refined
  card list (featured image, category pill, byline, excerpt, read-more).
* New two-column reading layout with a sticky, fully styled sidebar.
* Reworked typography: modular type scale, comfortable measure, polished
  single-post styling for headings, blockquotes, lists, code, and tables.
* Added graceful gradient placeholders for posts without a featured image.
* Accessible mobile navigation toggle with a no-JS fallback.
* Styled pagination, post navigation, comments, comment form, search, and 404.
* theme.json palette and font sizes aligned with the stylesheet.
* New screenshot reflecting the redesigned homepage.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release.
