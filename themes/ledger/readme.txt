An authoritative editorial and magazine theme with a real masthead, a full-width lead-story homepage, and a CSS drop cap on single posts.

== Description ==

Ledger is a print-inspired WordPress theme for news, magazines, and editorial
blogs. It pairs an off-white paper background with near-black serif type and a
single red accent for an authoritative newsstand feel.

The front page opens like a real newspaper: a dateline strip, a centered masthead
flanked by hairline rules, a sticky navigation bar, and a full-width LEAD STORY
that places a large featured image beside a bold headline, small-caps byline, and
standfirst. Below the fold, a "More Stories" grid lays out secondary articles in a
two-column hierarchy with category kickers and excerpts, while a column-ruled
sidebar carries the site's widgets.

Single posts are tuned for long-form reading: a comfortable measure, a generous
type scale, a CSS drop cap on the first paragraph, styled blockquotes and
pullquotes, and threaded comments. Featured images are rendered tastefully on the
index, single posts, and pages, and every layout degrades gracefully when a post
has no image.

Features:

* Full-width lead-story homepage with a masthead, dateline, and sticky nav
* Signature "LATEST" headline ticker and a crisp, accessible motion system
  (scroll reveals, drawing rule-lines, reading-progress bar, duotone hovers)
* "More Stories" two-column grid for secondary articles
* Column-ruled article + sidebar layout
* Serif body type tuned for long-form reading (comfortable measure)
* CSS drop cap on the first paragraph of single posts
* Small-caps bylines and category kickers above headlines
* Tasteful featured-image treatment on index, single, and page templates
* Custom logo, primary navigation menu (with dropdowns), and a widgetized sidebar
* Threaded comments, accessible focus states, and prefers-reduced-motion support
* Block editor color palette and font sizes via theme.json
* Translation-ready (text domain: ledger)

== Installation ==

2. Choose ledger.zip and click Install Now.
3. Click Activate.
4. Under Settings > Reading, set your homepage to display your latest posts to get
   the full lead-story treatment.

== Changelog ==

= 1.4.0 =
* Native integration with the free WPAI companion plugins via add_theme_support( 'wpai-companions' ).
* Single posts now fire wpai_entry_top (after the headline, byline, and featured image, before the article body) and wpai_entry_bottom (after the article body, before the tags/comments). These hooks fire outside the prose column so companion output can break the reading measure.
* Reading Time Badge and the Contents box render above the article, styled as native Ledger chrome: small-caps labels, the accent wash, square editorial corners, and ruled boxes aligned to the reading measure.
* Kindred related posts ("You might also like") render below the article at full article width, with serif card titles, small-caps dates, hairline rules, a drawn section-heading rule, and the theme's duotone-to-colour hover on card images.
* No double-rendering: when these companions detect the theme they render via the hooks instead of filtering the_content; on themes without support they keep their classic placement.

= 1.3.0 =
* New signature "LATEST" headline ticker beneath the masthead — a seamless, pausable newswire marquee of recent posts.
* Added a crisp, journalistic motion system: staggered scroll reveals for the lead story, "More Stories" cards, and archive entries via IntersectionObserver.
* Masthead hairlines and section-heading rules now draw across on entry; the dateline settles in with a press-start cue on load.
* Thin red reading-progress bar fills as you read a single post.
* Duotone-to-colour contrast shift on featured-image hover.
* All motion is self-contained vanilla JS/CSS (no libraries), animates only transform/opacity, and is fully gated behind prefers-reduced-motion. Progressive enhancement: all content stays visible without JS via an `html.js` flag.

= 1.2.0 =
* Added Customizer "Colors & Style" controls (accent, background, and surface colors) with instant live preview.
* Site title and tagline now update live in the Customizer via selective refresh.
* Derived accent shades follow the chosen accent automatically via color-mix(), so one control restyles the whole theme.

= 1.1.0 =
* New magazine front page: dateline strip, centered masthead, and a full-width lead story.
* Added a "More Stories" secondary grid with featured-image cards.
* Refined typography, color contrast, sidebar widgets, comments, and navigation (with dropdowns and sticky bar).
* Tasteful featured-image heroes on single posts and pages; graceful no-image fallback.
* Accessibility: stronger focus states, reduced-motion and print styles, improved escaping.
* Updated screenshot, theme.json palette, and editor styles.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release.
