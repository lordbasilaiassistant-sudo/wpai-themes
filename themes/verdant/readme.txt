A calm, organic theme for wellness studios, gardens, and small local businesses.

== Description ==

Verdant is a restful, nature-inspired WordPress theme built for wellness studios,
gardeners, and small local businesses. A light paper canvas, sage and forest greens,
soft generous rounding, and a humanist sans paired with a gentle serif give it a
friendly, trustworthy feel with plenty of breathing room.

The homepage opens with a warm welcome hero (anchored on your site tagline) and then
promotes your latest story to a wide "lead" card with a full-bleed featured image.
The rest of the posts follow as tidy image-and-text cards. A two-column layout keeps a
sticky widget area beside your content. No page builders, no bloat, no tracking — just a
quiet, growing space.

Features:

* Gentle homepage welcome hero that uses your site tagline
* Promoted lead story plus soft rounded featured-image cards (graceful fallback when a post has no image)
* Category eyebrows, refined post meta, and an animated "continue reading" link
* Two-column layout with a sticky, card-style widget area
* Soft rounding, rounded pill buttons, and subtle leaf-green dividers
* Serif headings paired with a humanist sans for restful reading
* Custom logo, primary navigation menu, dropdown sub-menus, and featured images
* Threaded comments, styled comment form, accessible visible focus states, and reduced-motion support
* Polished single, page, search, pagination, footer, and 404 templates
* Block editor color palette and font sizes via theme.json
* Translation-ready (text domain: verdant)

== Installation ==

1. In wp-admin go to Appearance > Themes > Add New > Upload Theme.
2. Choose verdant.zip and click Install Now.
3. Click Activate.
4. Set a site tagline under Settings > General and a Primary Menu under Appearance > Menus.

== Changelog ==

= 1.4.0 =
* New: native integration with the WPAI companion plugins. The theme now declares `add_theme_support( 'wpai-companions' )` and fires `wpai_entry_top` / `wpai_entry_bottom` action hooks around the article body on single posts.
* New: companion output (the Reading Time badge and Contents box at the top, the Kindred "You might also like" related posts at the bottom) now renders outside the prose column — so the related-posts grid can span the full article width — and is styled to match Verdant's palette, rounding, type, soft shadows, and soft-spring motion.
* Compatibility: when a companion is active without theme support nothing changes; the hooks only fire on single posts (pages may fire them harmlessly), and Smooth Back to Top and Beacon are unaffected.

= 1.3.0 =
* New: organic motion system — gentle float-up scroll reveals with a soft stagger (IntersectionObserver), a living "breathing" hero glow, and an organic mask reveal on featured images.
* New: signature drifting botanicals — a few hand-drawn leaf and seed shapes that slowly drift behind the hero and footer, each on its own path and rhythm (pure CSS).
* New: soft-spring hover micro-interactions — cards settle in, links grow an animated underline, and buttons press with a gentle spring.
* Accessibility: every animation is gated behind prefers-reduced-motion (both JS and CSS), content ships fully visible without JS (progressive enhancement via a `js` class), and keyboard focus is never trapped or hidden.
* Performance: motion animates only transform/opacity, reveals unobserve after firing, and the deferred footer script never blocks first paint.

= 1.2.0 =
* New: Customizer color controls (accent, background, and card surface) under Appearance > Customize > Colors & Style, with instant live preview — recolor the whole theme with no code.
* New: derived accent shades follow the chosen accent automatically via color-mix, and the site title/tagline update live.

= 1.1.0 =
* New: gentle homepage welcome hero anchored on the site tagline.
* New: promoted lead story card and refined image-and-text post cards with category eyebrows.
* New: graceful botanical placeholder when a post has no featured image.
* Improved: reworked color system, type scale, single/page, comments, sidebar, 404, and footer.
* Improved: sticky widget area, dropdown sub-menus, reduced-motion support, and AA contrast throughout.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release.
